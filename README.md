- Windows Server 2022 SCCM Server
- Windows 11 Workstation

## Setup Steps
1. Configure static IPs on each VM.
2. Install and configure Active Directory, DNS, DHCP.
3. Join all VMs to the domain.
4. Install SQL Server, SSRS, and SCCM.
5. Extend AD Schema and deploy clients.
6. Verify deployment via Configuration Manager Console.

### 2. Splunk Fraud Detection Dashboard
- Used Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu to ingest and visualize financial transaction data
- Created indexes and dashboards to identify fraud by age, gender, merchant, and category
- Used Splunk's ‚ÄúInteresting Fields‚Äù to create filters for detecting anomalies

üìÅ Folder: `/Splunk-Dashboard/`

#### `/Splunk-Dashboard/README.md`
```markdown
# Splunk Fraud Detection Dashboard

## Overview
This project uses Splunk Enterprise to visualize financial fraud patterns across customer demographics and transaction details.

## Dataset Fields
- Age, Gender, Merchant, Category, Amount, Fraud Flag

## Dashboard Charts
- Fraud Count by Category
- Fraud Trends by Age, Gender, Merchant
- Top 5 Merchants by Fraud Reports

## Setup
1. Install Splunk on Ubuntu Server 24.04.
2. Import CSV data using "Add Data" in Splunk.
3. Use "Interesting Fields" for dynamic filters.
4. Create dashboard panels using search queries.

### 3. Incident Response Simulation
- Simulated email phishing attack targeting an HR department
- Drafted a full response plan including identification, containment, eradication, and recovery
- Suggested implementation of MFA, HIPS/IPS, and user awareness training

üìÅ Folder: `/IncidentResponse-Phishing/`

#### `/IncidentResponse-Phishing/README.md`
```markdown
# Incident Response Simulation ‚Äì Phishing Attack

## Overview
This case study walks through a simulated phishing attack and details a complete IR response.

## Attack Scenario
- Phishing email from fake HR account
- Users submitted credentials and downloaded malware

## Response Steps
1. Identify impacted users and systems
2. Contain malware and disable accounts
3. Eradicate malware and patch vulnerabilities
4. Recover affected systems
5. Educate users and revise email security protocols

## Screenshot Examples
![Phishing Email Example](images/phishing-email.png)
![Incident Flowchart](images/incident-flow.png)

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of simulated phishing training
- Need for layered email filtering and MFA
```

### 4. Scripts and Automation (Optional/Future Additions)
- Collection of PowerShell or Bash scripts used in lab automation or data forwarding

üìÅ Folder: `/Scripts/`

#### `/Scripts/README.md`
```markdown
# Custom Scripts

This folder contains PowerShell and Bash scripts used during the cybersecurity lab deployments and automation.

## Contents
